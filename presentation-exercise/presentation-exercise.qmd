In this exercise, I recreated the bar graph that illustrates the share of political donations from team owners in six major sports leagues (NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLB, and NASCAR) to the Republican and Democratic parties over three election years: 2016, 2018, and 2020 from the FiveThirtyEight page here [Link](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/inside-the-political-donation-history-of-wealthy-sports-owners/). The graph shows a significant majority of donations going to the Republican party in all three years. The annotation highlights that Giants owner Charles Johnson's contributions constitute a substantial portion of the total Republican donations, underscoring the influence of individual donors in political contributions.

Table: Partisan Contributions by League

The table breaks down the total political contributions from owners and commissioners in six sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, WNBA, and NASCAR) to the Republican and Democratic parties from 2016 to 2020. It reveals that MLB owners have donated the most overall, with significant amounts going to both parties, but predominantly to Republicans. The table provides a clear comparison of partisan contributions across different leagues, highlighting the disparity in political support within the sports industry.

Both visuals emphasize the substantial financial support sports team owners provide to political parties, predominantly favoring the Republican party, and the considerable influence of a few key donors.
